# Messenger Interactionator

## Facebook Messenger Nickname Parser

This is a simple script that is designed to read in a json dump of a Facebook messenger group chat then pull the nicknames out so you can see who's been called what

It's supposed to be a bit of fun between me and some friends but thought I'd share it incase anyone else fancied using it

## Unzippa

When you do export your data from Facebook it gives it to you in a tonne of smallish (around 2 to 3 gb) zips files
This script unzips them all and merges them all into one folder
Then it can rezip up the merged folder and delete the extra stuff it created along the way
